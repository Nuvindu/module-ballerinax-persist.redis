# Overview

This module provide Redis database support for the `bal persist` feature, which provides functionality to store and query data from a Redis database through a data model instead of writing Redis commands.

Since Redis is not the default datastore for `bal persist` you need to explicitly specify the data store when initializing `bal persist` in your application. as follows,

```
$ bal persist init --datastore redis
```

## Supported Ballerina Data Types
The following table lists the Ballerina data types supported by the Redis data store. Following data types will be converted to `string` when inserting data and converted back to relevent data types in ballerina when retrieving.

|  Ballerina Type  |
|:----------------:|
|       int        |
|      float       |
|     decimal      |
|      string      |
|     boolean      |
|    time:Date     |
|  time:TimeOfDay  |
|    time:Civil    |
|     time:Utc     |
|       enum       |

## Configuration

You need to set values for the following basic configuration parameters in the `Config.toml` file in your project to use the Redis data store.

| Parameter  |             Description              |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    host    |    The hostname of the DB server.    |
|    port    |      The port of the DB server.      |
|  password  |    The password of the DB server.    |

The following is a sample `Config.toml` file with the Redis data store configuration. This is generated by the `bal persist generate` command.

```toml
[<packageName>.<moduleName>]
host = "localhost"
port = 6379
password = ""
```

## How To Setup
Use docker as follows to create a DB server deployment.

* Run `docker pull redis` to pull the official Redis Docker image from the Docker Hub
* Run `docker run --name <your-redis-container-name> -p 6379:6379 -d redis`
