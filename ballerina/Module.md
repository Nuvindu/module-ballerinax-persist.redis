# Module Overview

This module provide redis database support for the `bal persist` feature, which provides functionality to store and query data from a redis database through a data model instead of writing redis commands.

Since redis is not the default datastore for `bal persist` you need to explicitly specify the data store when initializing `bal persist` in your application. as follows,

```
$ bal persist init --datastore redis
```

## Supported Ballerina Types
The following table lists the Ballerina types supported by the Redis data store. Following data types will be converted to string when inserting data and converted back to relevent data types in ballerina when retrieving.

|  Ballerina Type  |
|:----------------:|
|       int        |
|      float       |
|      string      |
|     boolean      |
|       enum       |
|        ()        |

## Configuration

You need to set values for the following basic configuration parameters in the `Config.toml` file in your project to use the Redis data store.

| Parameter  |             Description              |
|:----------:|:------------------------------------:|
|    host    |    The hostname of the DB server.    |
|    port    |      The port of the DB server.      |
|  password  |    The password of the DB server.    |

The following is a sample `Config.toml` file with the Redis data store configuration. This is generated by the `bal persist generate` command.

```toml
[<packageName>.<moduleName>]
host = "localhost"
port = 6379
password = ""
```

## How To Setup
Use docker as follows to create a DB server deployment.

* Run `docker pull redis` to pull the official Redis Docker image from the Docker Hub
* Run `docker run --name <your-redis-container-name> -p 6379:6379 -d redis
